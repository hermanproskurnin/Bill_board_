This educational project has been developed based on a technical assignment for creating an internet resource similar to a bulletin board.

Key features of the resource include:
1. User registration using email. After registration, each user receives an email with a unique confirmation code for their account.

2. The ability to create and edit announcements. Announcements consist of a title and text, which may contain various multimedia elements such as images and embedded videos.

3. The ability to respond to announcements from other users. Responses can include text messages. Users receive email notifications when they receive a new response.

4. A user's private page with responses to their announcements. On this page, users can filter responses, delete them, and accept them. Accepting a response also generates a notification for the user who submitted the response.

5. The ability to categorize a user's announcements into one of the predefined categories specified in the technical assignment.

6. The ability to send newsletters to users.

The project successfully implements all the tasks described above, providing a fully functional bulletin board in accordance with the technical assignment.
